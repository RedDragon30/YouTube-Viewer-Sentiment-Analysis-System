      "Comment by @UnseenDetails-f8n: Westland Michigan has been stolen from us by Asian technology companies like Samsung led to phony hospitals and health care like for life support or hair loss. All because John Glenn high school let Koreans in after some terumo seminar they forcefully did where they all back packed here from terumo or Japan’s fast transport thing where they pretend  they’re still in Okinawa. It’s just not the same with these people honestly they completely ruined it. It becomes a mixture of surrounding places or nothing. It’s some place everyone passes through and it had food and certain places to live. They even started using and growing weed like they were the Netherlands Amsterdam and places like Ann Arbor, that was fake hash bash wise 2008 was the first one. We set the tone for following years and even the kind of weed smoked changed not meaning strains. It became a joke. It’s highly recommended not to buy anything except for Apple same with knock off chargers and stuff causing it, harbor freight caused this to continue, there is no healthcare on the Silk Road, faking things cause real producers to terminate operation and names change or they just stop because just good and space is needed, just unwanted Asian people lived like that in urban capitalism pretending communism went on before not really children did it not middle aged adults. They may lose everything including Sony else because of this terumo business. They started doing stuff with like Iranians because they liked computers and office jobs. Their production is probably fake to cover up them producing other stuff for the stock exchange. So terumo may be the source of copyright and trademark infringement. Secrecy doesn’t matter bitcoin wise. Everyone just sat in apartments or places they owned like the purge in those simulations.\n",

In terms of being overpriced as all hell piece of mid hardware with questionable quality, Razer can only be rivalled by Apple, and even they do a bit more for their customers, as much as I actively dislike Apple and their products.<br>I decided to try out a Redmi laptop a year ago, precisely because I need some computational power on the go, which at the same time will not kill my back and knees because it&#39;s as heavy as a tank -- it&#39;s decidedly NOT a gaming laptop, in fact quite the opposite -- it was made to be as thin and light as possible, but it does rock some decent AMD CPU and Radeon GPU. Even so, I do occasionally play Insurgency Sandstorm, Dark Souls 3 and MGSV, and it squeezes out rather nice visuals with a playable framerate, so a nice middleground. I used to have an MSI GE60 -- it was a decent machine, with easily accessible RAM, CPU and storage slots, and you could even swap my lousy Intel i5 (or i3, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was an i5) to a slightly better i9 because there was an i9 GE60, and with their gaming lineup, you had such an option, but GOD did the laptop alone weigh a lot, and then there was also a power adapter -- literally a brick-sized thing, with the mass of at least a couple of standard bricks. Given its overall weight, I&#39;m assuming the intention was never to have it with you all the time, but rather to have a slightly more portable, compact and underwhelming desktop, but you could always use it as additional weights for your amateur ruck marches or whatever.\n",

In EU battery considered to be dangerous good only over 100Wh. Taking into consideration that typical smartphone battery is under 5V, it become dangerous around 20000mAh. This is far from the capacities offered today. This is a cost saving exercise as market holders (iPhone, Samsung) do not offer such capable batteries so there is no incentive to go all out. Companies opting to be just slightly above the mainstream devices and save a buck or two. Shame on Arun on misleading it&#39;s audience.\n",

And one back-up in a seperate location &quot;off-site&quot; this is only because both modern budget laptops and flash drives have similar types of memory, and it is prone to fail.

And that energy must have come from somewhere, and what has now been proven for those who are willing to see it by quantum physics, is that that energy came from another realm. It entered the material world, the physical realm from another realm. Well, is that not free energy? Is it not thereby proven that the entire world is created by free energy? So does that not mean it is also possible that technology could be created, that would be able to, so to speak, channel the energy from a different realm into the material realm, where it could then be used to perform physical work or at least create electricity that could power machines that perform physical work.gy. And that energy can then enter the material realm and become physical matter. If you take this and put it together with a big bang, you can see that, is it actually logical that all of the matter and all of the energy that is now in this huge universe was compressed into something called a singularity? Whatever that may be. Is this really logical?\n",

They were better times and I do wish them back... I love modern tech, but that&#39;s about it, everything else was better back then. We were all richer, safer, happier, it was great until corrupt left politicians started destroying the whole western world with corruption and mass migration (which always hurts both countries because one gains crime and loses money while the other loses young labor and the only chance to change for better) while also stealing even more tax money to fix their power by buying judges to destroy free speech and having an opinion and founding thousands of (not) NGOs created to spread propaganda, hate and misinformation. And forcing the people to pay for state propaganda.  And they keep people dumb by controlling the education system, where there&#39;s no more knowledge transfer anymore at all but only propaganda and indoctrination...\n",

I see the accessibility features of it being a useful addition to helping those with vision impairments particularly. How I see it is that, for a vision impairment like mine, discerning what am I looking at, where is this object, and can you help me by doing ___. Perhaps a bit optimistic but imagine having the pair of glasses on and your eyes are so broken that finding a screw on the floor that you dropped is quite the task. Sure, you can get on your knees and search with your hands as I do for a bit or short time. However, use those glasses like the Meta glasses, ask it- “Hey ___, can you help me find a screw on the floor?” And like those AR ‘try on’ or ‘place furniture in your home’ options you find on apps- it could use a camera in the frames to detect a possible screw on the floor and place a ‘search area’ square on where you need to check. Or for another example, place a reticle that tracks movement from your good eye to then drag the reticle in front of your bad eye so that your lazy or wandering eye can stay in sync and you can get a more semi-functioning eyesight with both eyes working in tandem. Hopefully someone out there can do it or I can dream and try to.\n",

      "Comment by @Oceanwaves-d8l: I can see how adblock can be considered a form of piracy, but I would argue that it&#39;s weird because traditional internet piracy and using adblock usually have <i>completely</i> different intentions.<br><br>I&#39;m going to say this as an average user — most people are perfectly fine with watching ads. We accept that it&#39;s the method of &quot;paying&quot; to use the website, and are willing to do it. I actually like using the ads as a bit of time to quickly do some extra flashcards. <b><i>However,</i></b> we just want to use the internet safely. We don&#39;t want to suddenly be taken to a scam or malware website at a mistap or misclick. I&#39;ve mistapped ads before, and thank God they were legitimate ones because honestly the vast majority of them are, but I still don&#39;t want to use YouTube on my phone as a result. People realising that this is a risk encourages them to use adblock, not simply the desire to not see any ads.<br><br>I&#39;d say for this reason that using an adblock is more like using an antivirus than it is piracy.\n",

With these I&#39;m <i>specifically looking</i> for the creator&#39;s opinion on <i>this</i> particular product, because either I&#39;m <i>already looking to buy</i> a product in this category, or because the creator is entertaining enough that <i>I don&#39;t care that I&#39;m watching an ad.</i> It&#39;s all about content, and bad ads <i>will</i> drive away viewers.\n",

Like Chinese roovers are great for cheaper price but might explode suddenly or break easily. Same issue with tv.Those old brands tend to last decades. I think household techs, people tend to use for linger time compared to phone, laptop etc. so buy cheap ones each year vs buy decent one for longer time. Specially important when choosing tv,fridge,aircon,oven, microwave, electric bike etc. small things like  speakers don&#39;t really matter you can buy something that costs 1$. No need to spend fortune on those.\n",

Any studie trying to see cancer risks with aspertame have esentially ruled out the possibility, but the terrible reputation is a mix of pressure from big-sugar and bad journalism misscharacterizing research that show it is safe.  Current research says you would have to eat many times more the amount of aspartame than any human could conceivable eat for the tiniest of risk, while sugar offers a similar risk at the same sweetness (slightly worse) while also worsening diabetes and causing obesity, and terrible for your teeth. <br><br>All in all, I would say that at reasonable intake (less than your water intake per day) has zero tangible risks whatsoever. The main reason is the process in which Aspartame is broken down in the body, we convert it to a mix of aspartic acid (Amino acid, think protein), Phenylanine (Essential for life amino acid, think protein)  and methanol (Bad, but orange juice or milk has more, anything which has sugar naturally, etc.).\n",

It&#39;s unbearably sweet with no sugar,  technically. A single grain of stevia/aspartame is equivalent to the same sweetness of a full sugar cube.
